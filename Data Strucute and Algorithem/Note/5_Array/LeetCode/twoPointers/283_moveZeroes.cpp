/*
    Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

    Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

    ex1.
        Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
        Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

    ex2.
        Input: nums = [0]
        Output: [0]

    Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 104
    -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
