    Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
    Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

    A palindrome string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.
    
    ex1.
        Input: s = "aab"
        Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]

    ex2.
        Input: s = "a"
        Output: [["a"]]

    Constraints:
        1 <= s.length <= 16
        s contains only lowercase English letters.
